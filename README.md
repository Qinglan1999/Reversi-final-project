# Reversi-final-project-
This is for Software Carpentry (EN.540.635) final project

Dependancies:
Python 3.9
Tkinter

The program is run with:
main.py

In this project, I used the tkinter package to make a player vs computer Reversi game. The game follows the most basic and traditional Reversi rules. I do not know how to set up AI, so I only gave the computer a basic set of logic to choose a reasonable step (the most flipped flips and priority to choose the four corners). The computer level is medium level, and beginners can easily win when they learn the baisc logic. The basic rule of Reversi can be found in wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi.

Things that can be improved upon:
Get a better AI.
Add sound effects.
Add the action of flipping tiles to make the game look better.
Add player vs player mode.
